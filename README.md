## [Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](https://github.com/ahmetkca/React-Software-Architecture/tree/server-side-rendering)
> When your **server is the one that renders** your React code to HTML **instead of user's browser**.

## [State Management](https://github.com/ahmetkca/React-Software-Architecture/tree/state-management)
> How an application **handles the data needs** of its components, with regards to **loading, storing, persisting, and sharing this data**.


## [Data Loading and WebSockets](https://github.com/ahmetkca/React-Software-Architecture/tree/data-loading-and-websockets)
> Data loading with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

## [Code Splitting](https://github.com/ahmetkca/React-Software-Architecture/tree/code-splitting)
> Many JavaScript frameworks bundle all dependencies into one large file and React is not an exception. In theory it should speed up page loads and lower the amount of traffic that page needs to handle. At certian point, however a bundle grows to a certian size at which the overhead of interpreting and executing the code slows page load down. ***Code Splitting*** is the splitting of code  into various bundles or components which can then be loaded **on demand** or **in parallel**.
