## [Folder Structure-and-Naming-Conventions](https://github.com/ahmetkca/React-Software-Architecture/tree/folder-structure-and-naming-conventions
> **Monoliths**: All the code for the project is included in a single codebase, which generally has to be modified and deployed all at once.

> **Multi-repos**: The project's code is seperated into multiple codebases, each of which can usually be worked on and deployed independently.

> **Monorepos**: Monorepos are a mix of monoliths and multi-repos. They keep all the cide in the same codebase but organize it so each piece is largely independent.
